If you prefer reading to watching, we have prepared some brief overviews of Quaker Values and Quaker Testimonies to help you understand what we stand for. We hope these materials resonate with you. If they do, we warmly invite you to explore further by attending one of our meetings, either in person or online, or by visiting a meeting closer to your location. We look forward to sharing in our community with you.
