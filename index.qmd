We are the Plainfield Friends, also known as Quakers. We have been in
Plainfield since the 1700s, and changed as the community has changed.

Today we are a continuing faith community. Our basic belief is that
every person has that of God within. This shapes our faith and our
social witness. 

We believe it is important to practice and nourish both.


Thus we hold worship services, and we take action upon the world to
advocate for just treatment of all.

::::

Quakers in the twenty-first century adopt contemporary lifestyles much
as other mainstream faith communities. The “Quaker” of the Quaker Oats
box is a historical image that is dated by 150 years. Our spiritual
community has no association with the brand or manufacturer. Today in
most Quaker congregations (we call them meetings) most members and
attenders are people who were not born Quaker. We offer a faith and
social witness that is open to seekers. If you want to learn more about
Quakers and their beliefs a great place to start is here:
